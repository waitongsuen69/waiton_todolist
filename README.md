# waiton_todolist
a basic "To-Do List" web application where users can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. We'll use React and js, but the concepts apply to any language and framework.

### **Set Up Your Development Environment**

- [x]  Install react
- [x]  Create a new GitHub repository and clone it to your local machine.

### **Build the To-Do List Application**

- [x]  Develop application with functionalities to display tasks, add a new task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.
- [x]  Write the application code and create HTML templates for the interface.
- [x]  Use Git to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

### **Implement Unit Tests**

- [ ]  Write unit tests for your application 
- [ ]  Run your tests to ensure your application works as expected.

### **Containerize Your Application with Docker**

- [ ]  Create a **`Dockerfile`** for your application.
- [ ]  Build the Docker image and run your application inside a Docker container to ensure it works.

### **Set Up Continuous Integration**

- [ ]  Use GitHub Actions to create a workflow that automates running your unit tests on every push to the repository.

### **Deploy Your Application to Heroku Using CI/CD**

- [ ]  Modify your GitHub Actions workflow to include automatic deployment to Heroku after successful tests.
- [ ]  Ensure your application is accessible online via a Heroku URL.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
