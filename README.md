a basic "To-Do List" web application where users can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. We'll use Python and Flask for simplicity, but the concepts apply to any language and framework.

### **Set Up Your Development Environment**

- [x]  Install Python and Flask.
- [x]  Create a new GitHub repository and clone it to your local machine.

### **Build the To-Do List Application**

- [x]  Develop a Flask application with functionalities to display tasks, add a new task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.
- [x]  Write the application code and create HTML templates for the interface.
- [x]  Use Git to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

### **Implement Unit Tests**

- [ ]  Write unit tests for your application using Pythonâ€™s **`unittest`** library.
- [ ]  Run your tests to ensure your application works as expected.

### **Containerize Your Application with Docker**

- [ ]  Create a **`Dockerfile`** for your application.
- [ ]  Build the Docker image and run your application inside a Docker container to ensure it works.

### **Set Up Continuous Integration**

- [ ]  Use GitHub Actions to create a workflow that automates running your unit tests on every push to the repository.

### **Deploy Your Application to Heroku Using CI/CD**

- [ ]  Modify your GitHub Actions workflow to include automatic deployment to Heroku after successful tests.
- [ ]  Ensure your application is accessible online via a Heroku URL.
